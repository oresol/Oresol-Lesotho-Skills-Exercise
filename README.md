This repository is intentionally empty, with only a Readme file. Your task if to submit a Pull Request with your version of implementing the task, and your PR will be reviewed by someone on our team.

## The Task: Simple Personal Blog

You need to create a personal blog with just three pages:

- Homepage: List of articles
- Article page
- Some static text page like "About me"


Also, there should be a Login mechanism (but no Register) for the author to write articles:

- Manage (meaning, create/update/delete) categories
- Manage tags
- Manage articles 
- For Auth Starter Kit, use [Laravel Breeze](https://github.com/laravel/breeze) (Tailwind) or [Laravel UI](https://github.com/laravel/ui) (Bootstrap) - that starter kit will have some design, which is enough: the design is irrelevant for accomplishing the task


**DB Structure:**

- Article has title (required), full text (required) and image to upload (optional)
- Article may have only one category, but may have multiple tags
